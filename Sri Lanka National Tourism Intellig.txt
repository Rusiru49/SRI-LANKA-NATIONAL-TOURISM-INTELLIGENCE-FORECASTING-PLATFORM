Sri Lanka National Tourism Intelligence & Forecasting Platform – Internship-Level Scope
Project Overview

A comprehensive data-driven platform that leverages historical tourism data, external datasets, and machine learning models to analyze, forecast, and optimize tourism planning in Sri Lanka. Designed to provide actionable insights for tourism authorities, businesses, and policymakers.

Key Achievements:

Interactive dashboards for trend visualization and KPI monitoring

AI-based forecasting of tourist arrivals

Automated data processing pipeline with real-time updates

Decision support and recommendation features

Core Features
1. Data Integration & Enrichment

Historical tourist arrival data (years, regions, seasons)

Weather and climate data for trend correlation

Event and festival data to capture tourism spikes

Flight, port, and transport data for origin analysis

Social media sentiment analysis to detect traveler preferences

Tech: Python (Pandas, NumPy), APIs, Web Scraping

2. Advanced Forecasting & Analytics

Models: XGBoost, ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM (ensemble forecasting)

Scenario-based forecasts: Predict impacts of events, natural disasters, or policy changes

Uncertainty quantification: Prediction intervals for better planning

Trend decomposition: Seasonal, trend, and residual analysis

Tech: Python (Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Statsmodels, Prophet, TensorFlow/Keras)

3. Interactive Dashboard & Visualizations

Overview dashboard with key KPIs: arrivals, revenue, occupancy rates

Year-over-year, monthly, and seasonal trend comparisons

Regional heatmaps and geospatial visualizations using Plotly & Folium

Role-based dashboard views (Analyst, Admin, Policy Maker)

Export-ready tables and PDF/Excel reports

Tech: Streamlit, Plotly, Folium, Dash (optional)

4. Recommendation & Decision Support System

Suggest optimal destinations for specific tourist types based on season and region

Cluster analysis to identify tourist segments and preferences

Automated alerts for high tourist influx or underutilized regions

Predictive KPIs for hotel capacity, marketing campaigns, and resource allocation

Tech: Python (Scikit-learn, ML clustering), Streamlit notifications

5. Data Processing & MLOps

Automated ETL pipeline: data ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering, and storage

Handling missing values, outliers, and anomalies

Versioned data and model tracking (MLflow or DVC)

Scheduled model retraining and dashboard updates (Airflow / cron jobs)

Cloud deployment (AWS/GCP/Heroku) with live API endpoints for predictions

Tech: Python, Pandas, NumPy, MLflow/DVC, Docker, AWS/GCP

6. Advanced Analytics & Insights

Correlation analysis with external factors: GDP, exchange rates, hotel occupancy

Clustering and segmentation of tourists by origin, season, and preference

What-if analysis for tourism strategies (e.g., marketing campaigns, new attractions)

Tech: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
